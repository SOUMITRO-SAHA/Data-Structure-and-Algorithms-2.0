# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-2.0

Welcome to the "Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-2.0" repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) topics implemented in multiple programming languages. The primary languages for this repository are Java and C++, but you'll also find implementations in JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by DSA topics, each containing subdirectories for different programming languages. Below is the basic folder structure:

All topics will have a similar folder structure like this:

```bash
├── topic /
|   ├── Java/
│   ├── C++/
│   ├── JavaScript/
│   ├── TypeScript/
│   ├── Go/
│   ├── Rust/
│   └── Python/

```

The overall repository structure will look like this:

```bash
Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-2.0/
├── Arrays/
├── Strings/
├── LinkedLists/
├── Trees/
├── Graphs/
├── Sorting/
├── Searching/
└── DynamicProgramming/
```

## Notes

You can find the notes for each topic in the corresponding topic folder:

1. [Array](./topics/01-array/array-notes.md)
2. [Strings](./topics/02-strings/strings-notes.md)
